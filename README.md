# authorship-verification
Code for authorship verification research project. (Code is a little messy right now, see paper for overview)

Website code can be found at [https://github.com/swan-07/streamlit-av](url)

Website hosted at [https://same-writer-detector.streamlit.app/](url)

Code detailed in this repo was run in Jupyter Notebooks, and model scripts (everything in the Models section below) was run on  RunPod with an A100 SXM.

Pipeline:

# Models

[https://github.com/swan-07/authorship-verification/tree/main/featurevector](url) has code for implementing the Feature Vector model, modified from the implementation in [https://github.com/janithnw/pan2021_authorship_verification/tree/main](url).

Run preprocess.ipynb to preprocess the data (takes a LONG time, I split it into multiple chunks to run at once and combined them in combine.ipynb). 

Run large_train_model.ipynb to create feature vectors and train the model.

Use large_predict.ipynb for predictions and getting important features.

[https://github.com/swan-07/authorship-verification/tree/main/siamesebert/methods](url) has code for implementing the Embedding model.

Run bert.ipynb to train the BERT model (based off the implementation in [https://github.com/JacobTyo/Valla/tree/main](url)).

Run logreg.ipynb to fit a logistic regression model to calibrate probability predictions based off of cosine similarity of the embeddings as well as do attention-based highlighting and predictions.
 
# Datasets
Dataset curated can be found on huggingface at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/swan07/authorship-verification](url)

Code for cleaning and modifying datasets can be found in [https://github.com/swan-07/authorship-verification/blob/main/Authorship_Verification_Datasets.ipynb](url) and is detailed in paper.

Datasets used to produce the final dataset are:

Datasets were cleaned, named entities were replaced with their general type in all except PAN14, PAN15, and PAN20, and datasets were restructured into dataframes with columns |text1|text2|same| where a value of 0 in same meant the two texts had different authors, while a value of 1 meant the two texts had the same author.

All datasets were split into train/test/verification, keeping the splits if given (see paper for specifics) and otherwise using a 0.7:0.15:0.15 split.
